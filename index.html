                                MEGA City was a vast, modern metropolis that resembled a futuristic depiction of Tokyo. Technologically advanced cars and motorcycles could have been found throughout its streets, while buildings across the city were encircled by Grind Rails.</p>

                            <p>The Doggpound was a Named Location in Fortnite: Battle Royale, that was added in Chapter 2 Remix on the island Apollo. It is a remixed version of The Agency in the ownership of Snoop Dogg.</p>    
                            <p>Imagine landing at the familiar, imposing structure of The Agency, but this time, it's been completely Snoop-ified! The sleek, somewhat sterile aesthetic of the original was replaced with a much more vibrant and laid-back vibe. You'd likely find graffiti art with a distinct West Coast hip-hop influence adorning the walls, maybe even some lowrider-inspired decorations scattered around.

                                The atmosphere would have been less about clandestine operations and more about a chill hangout spot, albeit one still heavily guarded by Snoop Dogg's crew. You might have even heard some iconic Snoop Dogg tracks playing on in-game radios as you explored the location.</p>
